        <h1> :) Circle Maze (: </h1>
        <h2> Objective </h2>
        <h3> 
            The Circle Maze is a simple game. Get a timer on another device and see how fast you can go through. You will control a circle using the mouse to move.
                       The objective is to get to the end. The game is pretty simple. All you have to do is get the circle to the end in time.
                       Try and beat your own personal records while also beating others around you.
                       Good Luck!
             </h3>

            <h4>For the game you use your mouse to control the character moving through the maze.  Start on the left and move the circle to the yellow pentagon.
            Guide the circle until you reach the end.  Enjoy! </h4>
     

            <h5>What I Learned</h5>

            <h6>In this unit I learned a lot regarding java script and how the language works. 
                I learned about how different types of code control different things as well as how the different codes used inside of java script. 
                For example CSS and HTML and what those each control individually. 
                Where one controls the text and the other colors of the website. 
                The main code java script controls the main part of the game the sprites, there appearances, where they are placed, the layout and more.
                 Finally I have learned this unit is that even if you don't understand and learn as much as others you still 
                 learn something and that is what you learned and you can build off of that expanding your knowledge.
